![App Preview](lightmap-preview.png?raw=true)

天津大学第十一届世界校友代表大会于 2017 年 10 月下旬举行。

受学校委托，负责开发提供校友点亮地图的单页应用 (SPA)，在一周时间内，有来自六十多个国家和地区的 23734 位校友参与。

虽然并没有人提出要求，以下为根据本次活动所得到的数据进行可视化。

The 11th Tianjin University Alumni Congress was held in late October 2017.

Entrusted by the school, a single-page application "Lighting the Map Together" was developed. In a week, 23,734 alumni from over 60 countries and regions participated.

After the congress, a series of data visualization was also designed & implemented - despite that no one actually needed them.
